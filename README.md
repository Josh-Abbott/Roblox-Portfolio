# Roblox-Portfolio
A brief synopsis with information regarding some of my work done on the Roblox platform in recent years.

## Solanas Resort
This game is a roleplaying experience where players could “work” as an employee and roleplay tending to other players. It included an in-game currency system where you earned “Resort Bux” periodically for playing that could be spent on activities and items. I programmed and oversaw the design and development of the project while working with a partner for UI and other assets. As the project eventually found more success, I would later lead a small team to expand its scale and develop new features. While the game is no longer available to play, it peaked at roughly 500 concurrent players and reached a total of 2.1 million unique plays.

  - This video is an earlier version of the game recorded by a Spanish YouTuber that currently has over 4.2 million views and 65,000 likes. It covers a few of the broad features of what the games consist of, including the restaurant and currency system.

  - This video is a much later version of the game taken by a user roleplaying as a staff member in which they primarily focus on some of the newer features. This includes various activities available, some free and some requiring the use of the “Resort Bux” currency. It also shows off some of the tools such as the bike and hoverboard that were purchasable. 

## Palm Bay
This game is another roleplaying experience on Roblox that seeks to simulate the environment of a suburban city. In it, players are able to either live as citizens or run to be council members of the city. As a citizen, they are able to find and work at jobs at various locations, buy a house, vote in elections, and purchase other miscellaneous items such as pets, scooters, and tools. As for elections, anyone can sign up to be in the race for 3 vacant positions and whoever received the most votes win. Upon winning, you are then able to vote with the other elected members to control aspects of the town such as laws and tax rates. I programmed and oversaw the development, design, and marketing of the project while working with the same partner as Solanas Resort for UI and other assets.

  - This video is a demo I recorded overseeing some of the various features mentioned above. I made a few modifications necessary to showcase features such as elections off without any other users present.

  - This links directly to an open version of the game, however, playing does require a Roblox account.

## Destiny Bay
This game is not yet finished and served as an original testing ground for many of the concepts mentioned in Palm Bay. However, in this one, players are in an interactive large-scale city where minigames would appear randomly in various locations to play and earn XP and currency to be used at stores and activities. Some examples of minigames that are completed include “Shopping List” (shown below) and Tag (Freeze, Regular, and Infection). I programmed and oversaw the development and design of the project while working with the same partner as Solanas Resort and Palm Bay for UI and other assets.

  - This video is another demo that I recorded showcasing the “Shopping List” minigame. I also had to make modifications to play it with only myself, however, in a normal game you would be playing with anywhere from 2-20 people at once. The goal of the game is to collect as many items in the shopping list as possible before the time runs out.
